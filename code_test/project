developed a file sharing system in which user can downlaod a file from a group of which he is a member of. downloading happens in multiple chunks paralally from available peers of the same group which is decided by piece selection algorithm. file integrity is maintained using sha1 hash.
(multiple peers can contain the same piece to decide which one to select)


user process runs in multiple threads where multithreading was implemented using posix library
one of the thread request the server for file information like which user contains which piece and ip/port of the user for communication.
after fetching, multiple threads communicates with peers for getting number pieces available and number of request peer is handling at point of time

fetches the piece information which is getting stored in server and

so before actually starting the download user process first fetches the piece information and
using multithreading in which one thread deals with the requests of piecesfrom th
